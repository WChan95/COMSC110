CLASS POLICY:
 
Expect to spend about 12 hours per week on this course listening to lectures, doing labs, and reading.
 
Lab assignments are posted on the class website.
 
Lab assignments are due at the evening of the due date indicated on the course outline. The final due date is 3 weeks from the due date for credit.
 
One point per day will be deducted for each late assignment from the final due date. Late work will be accepted until noon on Th May 13th. No credit will be awarded for any late work after that time.
 
The final exam and the midterm exam are both open book and open note.
 
Arrangements for missed exams must be made with the instructor in advance. Make-up exams can only be scheduled for a time period in which the instructor is conducting another exam.
 

 
Students are expected to follow the DVC Student Code of Conduct. Accordingly, no credit will be given for work that is not original. Students MUST type their own code, and NOT share code with other students. Points awarded for lab work that is later found to be not original will be withdrawn. Points awarded for work that is deleted from the Student File Area before grades are assigned at the end of the semester will be withdrawn.
 
Please submit course work to your instructor after you have double checked your work.
 
EXPTED STUDENT LEARNING OUTCOMES: Students completing the course will be able to:
•	Use variables, branching, looping, libraries, and subprograms.
•	Design, code, debug, test, and document programs written to solve diverse problems.
•	Apply the fundamentals of good programming structure and good programming practices.
•	Use data structures such as records, files, and arrays, and to assess their suitability for various applications.
•	Use C++ pointers or Java reference variables.
•	Use recursion.
